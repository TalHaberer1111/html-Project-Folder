    <h3>This is the latest blog post for our dog. Made on January 5th, 2016</h3>
      <p>
        Our dog is the greatest dog in the world. He is so much better than our cat. Our cat sucks. I hope he's ok while I am at code school.

    <h3>Our dog got beat up!</h3>
      <p>
        We walked into Lucifer, our cat, attacking our dog this morning. He was very scratched up, but we brought him to the vet and all is good.

    <h2>Why our dog is better than our cat</h2>
    <p>
      The following is a list of reason why:
      <ul>
        <li>He is happy</li>
        <li>He is loving</li>
        <li>He is not spawn of satan</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
